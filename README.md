# 170_AStarSearch
An implementation of A Star Search in solving the 8 Puzzle

By running 'Solver.java', you will generate a random state of the 8 Puzzle. The program can determine if the puzzle is solvable or not. If the puzzle is not solvable, it will generate another state. Else, it will use the A Star Search algorithm in finding the steps in solving the puzzle. The output is written on '8puzzle.out'.
